This DSL describes a contraction over a tensor network to calculate observables of interest in the form of a sequence of instructions which act on individual tensors. This makes it possible to separate the development of the high performance distributed tensor network computation code from that of the higher level contraction planning, circuit and and network manipulation code.

In the above the 1 index appears twice on the right hand side which indicates that this index should be contracted over.
